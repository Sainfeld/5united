<h2>
Servicing Item  4:  Battery
</h2>
 
<p>
Check every 3000 miles, but at least once a month, 
whether the acid level of the battery is within the level markings
of the acid level window.
If the level is too low, fill with distilled water (not acid).
The top of the battery should be kept clean and dry.
Protect the terminals against corrosion with grease.
<br>
<b> Caution! </b>
Do not let acid and lead oxides of the terminals touch your clothes.
Do not approach the battery with an open flame-danger of explosion.
</p>

<p>
If the motorcycle was not in use for a longer period of time,
the battery should be recharged once a month in order to prevent
the plates from sulfating.
Battery capacity, see
<a href="techdata.html">
Technical Data</a>.
<br>
<b> Caution! </b>
For recharging, remove the battery cables 
(not when engine is running),
otherwise there is the danger that the voltage peaks
generated by the charger will destroy the diodes.
