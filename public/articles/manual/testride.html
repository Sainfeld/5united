<p>
A test ride is to be taken after every service
to check the motorcycle for safe operation.
Watch in particular for proper functioning of the brake
and the ease of operation of the steering.

Final inspection  includes checking the condition
of the tires, the air pressure in the tires,
and the proper functioning of the lighting and
signal system.
