Roger's Disclaimer

<p>
I'm attempting to reproduce the owner's manual
as faithfully as possible, in the interest
of the safety and enjoyment of all who own
one of these wonderful bikes, but do not 
have an owner's manual, BMW's word on how to operate it.

<h2>Toby's Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Roger did an excellent job making the online owner's manual a
high-fidelity copy of the paper one.  I have made some changes that
improve the online rendering at the cost of drifting slightly from the
paper version.  In the technical data section, for example, Roger
preserved the page breaks so some tables got split into two pieces.  I
have joined them back together so their presentation works better
online.  I have also corrected some obvious typos and spelling
errors.</p>
