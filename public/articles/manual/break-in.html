<h2>
Break-in -- But How?
</h2>

<p>
Even the most carefully machined parts require a certain
break-in period.
The performance and longevity of your motorcycle
depends to a great extent on how carefully it is broken in.
The surest method is to:
<ul>
1.  Never exceed the permissible maximum speed in each gear
<br>
2.  Ride mostly on winding country roads; avoid turnpikes
<br>
3.  If turnpikes cannot be avoided, try to vary your speed constantly;
do not operate at a constant speed for long periods.
<br>
4.  Always approach the maximum allowable speed and immediately back off.
<br>
5.  The maximum allowable RPM up to 600 miles is 4000;
from 600 miles to 1200 miles it is 5000.
<br>
6.  Avoid rude braking up to 300 miles, especially at high speed.
Otherwise the brake pads won't get a good abrasion value in the future.
</ul>
</p>
