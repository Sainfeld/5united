<h2>
Servicing
</h2>

<p>
Please have all 
<a href="servicing.html">
the maintenance procedures laid down in the
Owner's Manual,
pages 16--31,</a>
carried out regularly by an authorized BMW dealer,
and make sure that the work done is confirmed by rubber stamp
and signature in the appropriate spaces of pages 72 and 73.
These details must be available before any guarantee claims
can be considered.
<br>
Before you receive this vehicle from your dealer he will have
carried out a 
<b>free pre-delivery check.</b>
These is a schedule of the volume of the inspection work on page 75.
Performance of that inspection work is verified on page 74.
After the 
<b>free services</b>
at 300 and 1000 miles, and commencing at speedometer reading 3000 miles,
alternate Minor Service and Major Service procedures should be 
carried out at 3000 mile intervals.
<br>
In the interests of obtaining maximum reliability and long service life
from your vehicle, we recommend that 
<b>at least two services per year</b>
be carried out even if the prescribed mileage as per 
<a href="servicing.html">
the servicing chart on page 16</a>
has not in fact been completed.
<br>
We have calculated work time schedules for all service operations,
and BMW importers or their authorized dealers will invoice you 
in accordance with the rates current in your country, 
using the official times as guides.
<br>
All lubricants, gaskets etc. used, any cleaning work necessary
will be shown separately on the invoice.
<br>
In all export markets it is customary to make an initial charge
for the free services Nos. 1 and 2.
Your dealer will then credit you with the officially recommended
value of this work.
Any sum in excess of this value you will be required to meet yourself.
<br>
Please keep this Owner's Manual in the tool box of your motorcycle
in the at all times.
<br>
The service supplement of this Owner's Manual is not transferable.
