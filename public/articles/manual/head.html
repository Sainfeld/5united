<b> Check valve clearance </b> --
required after each retightening of the cylinder head nuts --
with feeler gage between valve stem and rocker arm when
engine is stopped and cold.
To do this, unscrew spark plugs and turn engine over with
allen wrench (wrench size 6) at the alternator rotor bolt
until the cylinder to be adjusted is at 
<b>compression</b>
top dead center.  Both valves are closed.
If necessary, readjust clearance (wrench size 12) after
loosening the lock nut (wrench size 12), secure with lock nut,
recheck valve clearance.
