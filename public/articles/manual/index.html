BMW /5 Owners Manual
</h2>

<p>
Dear BMW Friend,
</p>

<p>
The motorcycle is a constant challenge to the man; 
a challenge to experience the adventure of man's 
command over the machine--directly, unadulterated.
Over and over again, wind, weather and road must
be conquered and mastered anew.
<br>
For this, the machine--
</p>

<p>
You chose a BMW with twin-cylinder opposed engine,
quick running with plenty of reserve power, and with
shaft drive--"the finest" as our American friends
put it simply.  We congratulate you on your decision.
</p>

<p>
Our Operating Instructions contain the information you
must know to fully enjoy riding your motorcycle, and
what care is needed to keep up the value of your investment.
Soon you will enjoy the feeling of being connected
with the name BMW.
</p>

<p>
Start now, experience the extraordinary:  Enjoy riding--
in City traffic, on narrow winding mountain roads,
along the stretches of endless super-highways.
</p>

<p>
Your
<br>
