	    <p>I would do the services on your R75/5 in this order:</p>

	    <ol>
	      <li>Change ALL oils.</li>

	      <li>Torque cylinder heads (25 foot pounds, loosen each nut 1/2 turn, 
		then torque, use crisscross pattern)., adjust rocker arm end play (zero 
		play, no rotational binding), adjust valve clearances (cold engine) to 
		.006" Intake, .008" Exhaust.</li>

	      <li>Service auto advance unit (don't snap the thread off the end of the 
		cam, tighten GENTLY!), grease point cam felt with a smear of grease.</li>

	      <li>Set points gap to 0.016" (0.40 mm) using a good feeler gauge, or 
		better yet a dwell meter, look for 39 degrees on the four cylinder 
		scale (gives you 78 degrees on a two cylinder).</li>

	      <li>Set ignition timing static setting to S mark on flywheel.Check full advance timing at 3200 RPM, the dot (or hole if the paint 
		  is gone) above the F mark should be steady in the center of the timing 
		  hole, aligned with the machined groove in the side of the hole.
	      </li>

	      <li>Service the air filter, i.e., put a new one. DO NOT blow out air 
		filter with compressed air, do not leave a K&amp;N filter in at all.</li>

	      <li>Drop carb float bowls and clean the tiny jet in the little well in 
		the corner of the bowl using a single strand of wire from a wire brush, 
		held with needle nose pliers. Make sure contact cleaner will spray 
		through the jet into the bowl.</li>

	      <li>Remove the main jet and jet holder (make a mental note of the depth 
		of engagement of the jet holder), drop down the needle jet and emulsion 
		tube, (keep your finger over the hole so they don't fall out and get 
		lost.) Use some Gumout carb cleaner spray to clean the gunk that has 
		accumulated above the jet holder. Spray the jets and emulsion tune 
		clean, then reinstall the emulsion tube, needle jet and jet holder. 
		Visually align the jets onto the needle carefully. As you screw the jet 
		holder up in with your FINGERS, if it doesn't seat fully (remember the 
		mental note?) then back it up about 1/32 of a turn and wiggle it as you 
		screw it in gently (FINGERS ONLY!) You will feel when the emulsion tube 
		finds its way up into the carb body hole. If you can;t get it , remove 
		the air tube from the air cleaner housing and visually see that the 
		emulsion tube projects up into the venturi about 3-4 mm. You can wiggle 
		the needle to help align it as you screw it up in with your FINGERS.</li>

	      <li>Check the float level setting by lifting the float gently with your 
		fingers. When the needle seats, BEFORE the spring loaded part begins to 
		depress, the seam in the float should be parallel to the float bowl 
		gasket surface. Reinstall the bowl carefully, making sure the gasket is 
		fully seated in the groove all the way around.</li>

	      <li>Check that the throttle cable has a tiny amount (1-2mm) free play 
		when the throttle grip is all the way back. Get the two sides as close 
		to the same free play as possible.</li>

	      <li>Check that the choke cable fully seats the lever on the post when 
		the lever is in the horizontal position. At half choke, the lever on 
		the carb should be halfway between the posts. At FULL choke position of 
		the hand lever, the choke lever should be all the way up to the top 
		post.</li>

	      <li>LIGHTLY screw the idle mixture screw IN until you feel the screw 
		seat. Now back the screw OUT by 3/4 turns (this setting varies for 
		other models).</li>

	      <li>Turn the idle SPEED screw OUT until it does not contact the 
		butterfly lever at all. Now screw the screw IN until it JUST touches 
		the lever, now turn it IN one FULL turn.</li>

	    </ol>

	    <p>These are the baseline settings. Now take the bike for a LONG test 
	      ride, at least five miles, to get it to FULL operating temperature. 
	      Riding around the block or starting and revving on the stand will NOT 
	      work.</p>

	    <p>At this point you need to synchronize the carburetors. This is 
	      accomplished either by shorting one cylinder at a time (this takes some 
	      practice to get right, usually you need somebody to show you once) or 
	      using a vacuum gauge on the vacuum takeoff ports on the side of the 
	      carb. Set the idle mixture on each carb at the point that gives best 
	      running, usually between 1/2- 1-1/4 turn out. Balance the idle speed 
	      screws, then balance the cable pull off idle. Recheck to be sure that 
	      you still have a tiny bit of free play of the cables. If not, readjust 
	      the cables.</p>

	    <p>This should get the bike running pretty well. Idle speed should be 
	      at 1000-1100 RPM. DO NOT set the idle for a super low "tickover", as 
	      this will severely reduce oil circulation in the engine and make the 
	      transmission rattle like a bag of rocks.</p>
