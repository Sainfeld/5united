          <p>Once in a while, someone would like to ask "what tires do
            I need to use on my bike? Any suggestions?" Then all hell
            breaks loose, because everyone has different preferences
            where it concerns tires.

          <pre>
            We'll start by putting everything in a row. What can you buy today, and what are the manufacturer's specs ?

            First of all, your rims are 1,85 front, 1,85 rear for pre-72 bikes and 1,85 front, 2,15 rear post-72. Diameter of the wheels is 19 inch front, 18 inch rear.

            The original tires were either Continental or Metzeler, and came in the sizes 3,25-19 front and 4,00-18 rear.

            What can you buy today, and what are the manufacturer's specs ?

            Avon :
            Avon specs the Roadrunners for the /5.

            325-19 54H AM20 front at 2,30 bar or 33 psi

            400-18 64H AM21 rear at 2,50 bar or 36psi

            One could use, as a very sticky sports tire, the AM18 rear tire in 100/90 57V 19 on the front and combine it with a Bridgestone BT45 rear. I know of no-one who tried that on a BMW.

            Bridgestone :
            Bridgestone specs different tires in the USA and Europe :

            USA : Spitfire

            100/90-19 Spitfire S11 front

            110/90-18 Spitfire S11 rear

            Europe : Battlax

            3,25-19 54H TL BT-45F front at 2,5 bar or 35 psi

            4,00-18 64H TT BT-45R rear at 2,8 bar 38,5 psi

            Metzeler
            Metzeler has a number of choices

            100/90-19 57H TL ME33 Laser front at 2,2bar or 31psi

            4,00-18 64S TL ME77 rear at 2,3 bar or 33 psi

            Alternatively :

            3,25-19 54S TL ME11 Perfect front at 2,2 bar or 31 psi

            4,00-18 64S TL ME77 rear at 2,3 bar or 33 psi

            You will also be able to fit a ME99A on the rear, but Metzeler doesn't recommend this tire for the /5.

            Continental
            Continental suggests the SuperTwin for the /5 :

            3,25-19 54 S/H TT TK22RC front

            4,00-18 64 S/H TT TK44RC rear

            Alternatively they give :

            3,25-19 54 H TT RB2 front

            4,00-18 64 S/H TT K112 rear

            Or else :

            100/90-19 56 H/V TT/TL TKV11 front

            110/90-18 61H TT/TL TKV12 rear

            no pressure specs here.

            Dunlop
            Dunlop says to put on your /5 :

            491 Elite II MM90-19 front at 2,3 bar or 32 psi

            491 Elite II 110/90 B18 rear at 2,55 bar or 36 psi

            or :

            F11 100/90-19 front at 2,3 bar or 32psi

            K627 110/90-18 rear at 2,55 bar or 36psi

            The K591 has been takes out of the assortment, and has been replaced by GT501

            You can try and put these on, but the rear tire will be too big. This can be solved by using a spacer on the rear wheel with BMW part nr 36 31 2 301 737, which is 10.7mm wide instead of 9.2 and makes the tire clear the swingarm.

            GT501 100/90-19 57V

            GT501 120/90-18 65V

            no pressure specs here.

            Michelin
            Michelin only has one thing on offer : the macadam 50(E)

            3,25-19-54H TT/TL on the front at 1,9 bar or 27 psi

            4,00-18-64H TT/TL on the rear at 2 bar or 28 psi

            There seems to be confusion about the « E », which appears in the USA but not in Europe.

            Pirelli
            Pirelli offers a number of tires that fit. They recommend the City Demons for the /5 :

            3,25-19 M/C TL 54H front at 2,20 bar or 31 psi

            4,00-18 M/C TL 64S/H rear at 2,30 bar or 33 psi

            Others that fit are the MT66 in metric and the MT69E and MT68E « Strada » in inch. You may be able to find something in MT65 too that'll fit, but the front tire will be a 90/90-19.

            Cheng Shin
            This company doesn't have a website. Among others, M6102 front and M6103 rear will fit.

            Maxxis
            This company is referenced as being the website for Cheng Shin- draw your own conclusions. The tire names are different though. Here they're called Promaxx. Use 100/90-19 62H/TL « Classic » or 100/90-19 57H/TL « Promaxx » front, and 110/90-18 61H/TL rear.

            IRC
            This company's website was last updated in sept. 1998

            Tires that will fit are RW010 100/90-19 57H front and 110/90-18 61H rear, or GS11 3,25 H19 4PR front and 4,00 H18 4PR rear.

            Most people feel it is important to have the exact right size tires, which means the inch measures and not the closest metric equivalent. A fatter front tire will make the bike handle like a truck. The difference with a proper 3,25 is night and day. A fatter rear tire may rub the swingarm unless a wider top-hat spacer is used, and is in any case a bear to get past the brake drum. Be aware of the fact that tire sizes will vary between manufacturers, even if the designation is the same. There will also be a difference between TT and TL tires. You have to use tubes, also in TL tires on our rims, but generally the TT tires, if available, will be a bit narrower. Use a TT when they have one.

            Interesting article in this respect at http://www.webbikeworld.com/Motorcycle-tires/sizes.htm

            Don't buy cheap tires. You get what you pay for, and a tire is what keeps your face off the asphalt. If you have to make an emergency brake manoeuvre, the difference between a Bridgestone and a Cheng-shin can make the difference between a metre to spare and a bent fork-or a lot, lot worse. Keep that in mind.

            Now we will go down the list again and add some general comments about the various tires listed. These come from a website from which I have shamelessly stolen them, alas, I've lost the URL and cannot find it anymore. Thank you, whoever you are !

            Avon :
            325-19 54H AM20 front at 2,30 bar or 33 psi

            400-18 64H AM21 rear at 2,50 bar or 36psi

            Avon's bias-ply general purpose tyre. It's an excellent cruiser or touring tyre. Dry and wet traction are very good, and the progressive profile of the front gives excellent straight-line stability with a linear profile once leaned over.

            Super Venom (AM20/AM18)

            Without doubt, this is the finest bias-ply sport tyre available. The straightline stability combined with linear profile once the bike leans (also shared with the Roadrunner) makes it an excellent choice to combine with a harder-wearing rear. Like the Roadrunner, it also works very well indeed with tyres from other manufacturers.

            The downside of the Super Venom is that the AM18 rear wears quickly, and squares off easily. While unquestionably superb for sport riding, this has drawbacks for bikes that are used for other purposes. In those cases, I suggest combining the Super Venom AM20 front with a harder-wearing rear, such as the dual-compound Bridgestone BT45 rear.

            Some narrow sizes of the Super Venom rear can also be fitted on the front. I would personally choose an AM20 front over an AM18 every time, because of the former's profile, but there are some sizes the AM20 does not cover. In that case, an AM18 front is a good sport choice.

            Bridgestone :
            100/90-19 Spitfire S11 front

            110/90-18 Spitfire S11 rear

            If the price is right, this is a good choice. It's a dual-compound tyre, with harder rubber in the centre of the tread for longer life droning down the highway, and a relatively softer compound on the edges of the tyre. Unlike the BT45, however, the "softer" does not mean it's up to sport riding, just that it gives better traction than one would expect for a tyre that lasts reasonably long. It's a decent general-purpose tyre, a good choice for commuters or those with a tight budget.

            3,25-19 54H TL BT-45F front at 2,5 bar or 35 psi

            4,00-18 64H TT BT-45R rear at 2,8 bar 38,5 psi

            Battlax BT45

            This tyre us available in both H- and V-rated versions; aside from the speed rating and range of sizes, there's no perceivable difference between the BT45H and BT45V. The rear has a dual tread compound construction that combines a harder central band, to resist squaring off and for longer life, with a softer, stickier compound on the edges.

            This is a superb tyre. This is the model with which Bridgestone introduced their new silica-rich compound, and thus took an enormous leap in wet traction. Also, the dual tread compound works exactly as described -- it wears well in normal riding, while the outer edges stick very well. It's even capable of hard track use -- I've used it that way on both ends of the weight range, a track-prepped Yamaha RD400 and a Moto Guzzi California 1100i.

            There is no question that a pair of BT45's is one of the best bias-ply sets you can buy.

            If your bike is easy on front tyre wear, though, and the sizes work out, using a BT45 rear with an Avon Super Venom front is an unbeatable combination. The Avon adds excellent highway stablity, confidence-inspiring profile, and ultra-sticky traction, while the BT45 wears well and sticks very well in the corners. The Avon, designed to work well with a wide range of rears (note that Avon themselves say you can combine it with other manufacturers' products), lives up to its promise; while Bridgestone has finally perfected the dual-compound rear.

            Metzeler
            100/90-19 57H TL ME33 Laser front at 2,2bar or 31psi

            4,00-18 64S TL ME77 rear at 2,3 bar or 33 psi

            3,25-19 54S TL ME11 Perfect front at 2,2 bar or 31 psi

            4,00-18 64S TL ME77 rear at 2,3 bar or 33 psi

            ME-33 Laser Sporttouring / Allround Front only, can be used with any other Metzeler bias rear. In fact, it's designed to work well with any other rear -- Metzeler claims it damps out any oscillations that could be caused by otherwise incompatible tyres.

            ME-77 Perfect Sporttouring / Allround Generic standard tyres.

            Dunlop
            491 Elite II MM90-19 front at 2,3 bar or 32 psi

            491 Elite II 110/90 B18 rear at 2,55 bar or 36 psi

            The 491 sets the standard for bias-ply touring tyres. It is an excellent choice for touring and cruising bikes alike. With the demise of the Avon Elan series, it becomes the undisputed leader for tread life under load. For a touring tyre, it performs very well in wet and dry. The profile is particularly well suited to cruisers -- the less rounded profile of the rear when compared to other brands can give the effect of extra ground clearance. Harley-Davidson riders swear by these much like BMW riders swear by Metzelers, and for good reason. They're excellent tyres.

            GT501 100/90-19 57V

            GT501 120/90-18 65V

            This is a replacement for the well-respected K591. It fills the same niche, that of a bias-ply performance tyre, but with an updated compound and tread pattern. I have not had much experience of these tyres -- first- or second-hand -- and so I'm not sure how they perform. I see no reason, however, to doubt that they're a good tyre.

            Pirelli
            Pirellis are made by the same company that makes Metzelers, and in general there's a fairly direct product comparison between the product lines; one big difference is that the comparable Metzeler is usually the cheaper of the two.

            Cheng Shin
            Awful "tyres", both in design and in quality. These are the worst you could possibly buy -- don't do it under any circumstances. Kenda and IRC are vastly superior at a similar cost.

            Then we'll finally move on to what actual list members and /5 riders have had to say about these tires in the past :

            Avon :
            Avon specs the Roadrunners for the /5.

            325-19 54H AM20 front at 2,30 bar or 33 psi

            400-18 64H AM21 rear at 2,50 bar or 36psi

            First tire choice of Mark Weiss.

            Brett "Boocephus" Mitchell opines about Avons: Is it just me or do Road Runners only last a few thou? I

            only have 10K miles on my new speedometer and I know I've gone though 2 or 3 rear Avons. They are nice and sticky, but they get squared off in what seems like no time. I am probably one of the only non- overinflators on the list. I target for about 34, but I don't put any in until it gets below 30.

            Phil Marx : I've had no good luck with the Avons, even sent pics of the tread cracks to Avon and they sent replacement tires. Big deal, I'd rather not have tires that split.


            Phil also adds that the 325-19 and 400-18 sizes are hard to get in the US, and thinks that most of these axperiences have been with the (nearly) equivalent front Avon Roadrunner AM 20, 100/90x19
            and rear Avon Roadrunner AM 21 110/90x18. On top of that the 100/90-19 AM20 seems no longer available, and is substituted by the100/90-19 Venom X
            Another Philip : My first Avon (AM21) ran 10414 miles. It had some cracking but not near as bad as Phil's. The second Avon ran 9244 with no cracking. I installed a new front (AM20) with my first Avon rear and used it for both the listed rear tires (21903 miles). My current Avon rear has 6322 and still looks great.

            Bridgestone :
            100/90-19 Spitfire S11 front

            110/90-18 Spitfire S11 rear

            Paul Sotrop likes these better than Conti's and less than Dunlop 491's.

            Someone else says : For me, the Bridgestone Spitfire has been an outstanding tire. It's a dual compound tire, meaning the rubber in the center of the tire is a slightly harder compound, and the rubber on the shoulders is a

            slightly softer compound. I've yet to run into any trouble with these tires, and I've got probably about 4,000 miles on them. There's plenty of tread left. They're very reasonably priced as well, about $80 per tire from Dennis Kirk.

            Lyman Robertson says : I use Bridgestone S11 I have good service from them usually up to 20,000 rear and about 2x as long front, wet, dry, hot, cold, doesn't matter twisties stright away up hills down My R90/6 and current /5.

            Second best tire for Nick Grear, behind Michelin 50e and before Dunlop K491. Pricing (Front $50.97) and (Rear $57.97)

            3,25-19 54H TL BT-45F front at 2,5 bar or 35 psi

            4,00-18 64H TT BT-45R rear at 2,8 bar 38,5 psi

            I've tried these myself and love them. Dual compound, wear resistant centre, sticky sides. They did very well for the past 6000km and still lots of thread left. I am getting a bit of the infamous SWB headshake back now, which supposedly originates from the front tire. It was extreme with the Conti, and gone when these tires were new. Buy the tube type for the rear, as the tubeless is too wide for the swingarm without the wider spacer , BMW part nr 36 31 2 301 737, which is 10.7mm wide instead of 9.2 and makes the tire clear the swingarm.

            Metzeler
            100/90-19 57H TL ME33 Laser front at 2,2bar or 31psi

            4,00-18 64S TL ME77 rear at 2,3 bar or 33 psi

            3,25-19 54S TL ME11 Perfect front at 2,2 bar or 31 psi

            4,00-18 64S TL ME77 rear at 2,3 bar or 33 psi

            ME99 110/90-18 61H rear

            ME33/99 is the third favourite of Mark Weiss, behind the Avon roadrunners and the Dunlop 591 (now GT501 which doesn't fit anymore)

            Kim says his Metzeler ME33 Lazer requires 38 to 42 psi to feel right

            Charlie Baker says : (old threads) Metzeler ME33 'Lazer's' (front) & ME99A 'Perfect' ( rear) have had the same pattern for 30+ years. I like the front for handling, but they tend to cup rapidly on our weathered roads, & the rear is ok, but I prefer the Dunlop 491's ( I have 19K on mine,vs 4-7k for the Metz)

            .Someone else says : My over-priced, shit mileage (barely 3500) Metzler ME99 is over-priced and shit mileage (barely 3500). I like the ME33, it ran well with it's original ME99 rear and

            the Conti Blitz's I replaced it with.

            Still someone else adds : ME33 follows grooves

            Continental
            SuperTwin

            3,25-19 54 S/H TT TK22RC front

            4,00-18 64 S/H TT TK44RC rear

            Alternatively:

            3,25-19 54 H TT RB2 front

            4,00-18 64 S/H TT K112 rear

            Or else :

            100/90-19 56 H/V TT/TL TKV11 front

            110/90-18 61H TT/TL TKV12 rear

            no pressure specs here.

            Someone says : Conti still cranks out the RB2/K112 & Blitz tires in the right sizes but I

            wouldn't consider either a sport tire.

            Paul Sotrop says : period appropriate Continental tires. They wore out quickly at about 3000-4000 miles, were scary in wet weather, and terrifying on metal-grate bridges.

            Philip Rose says : I am still partial to the original Conti Twins. The RB2 front and the K112 Rear. Continental is still making these tires and they fit correctly, look correct and still give great performance

            K112 was stocked by Bondo back when Dunlop K81's could still be bought.

            Kim says : my /5 Continental Super Twin used to require 40 to 46 psi to feel right.

            Dunlop
            491 Elite II MM90-19 front at 2,3 bar or 32 psi

            491 Elite II 110/90 B18 rear at 2,55 bar or 36 psi

            F11 100/90-19 front at 2,3 bar or 32psi

            K627 110/90-18 rear at 2,55 bar or 36psi

            GT501 100/90-19 57V

            GT501 120/90-18 65V

            Mike Gary writes : I replaced the dried out Continentals she came with by putting on a pair of

            Dunlops. (ah, but which ones ?) The good news is these lasted for about 20,000 miles!! The bad news is that I went down three times with them. Good mileage is just not worth bouncing my butt on the pavement.

            491 is the third best tire of Nick Grear, behind Michelins and Bridgestone S11. (Front $64.97) and (Rear $78.97)

            Michelin
            3,25-19-54H TT/TL on the front at 1,9 bar or 27 psi

            4,00-18-64H TT/TL on the rear at 2 bar or 28 psi

            Many riders love the Macadams :

            I've had good experience with Michelin Macadam 50s. Michelin tubes worked fine too.

            Michelin recently updated the front tire to the Macadam 50H which is supposed to limit cupping of the front tire, a problem not unique to Michelin on BMWs and one which I've not experienced with my Macadam 50. . I don't think you can go wrong with these tires and they're fairly priced, too.

            I will heartily second Phil's recommendation of the Macadams but I would advise using the 50E on the front. Both my wife & I have had the 50 cup badly on our bikes & I believe it was replaced by the 50E last year so any

            50s are old stock.

            I'm a happy Macadam rider - 25,000+ on my SWB 75/5 with just one front and three rear tires.

            First choice of Nick Grear, before Bridgestone S11 qnd Dunlop K491 (Front $62.97) and (Rear $76.97)

            City Demons for the /5 :

            3,25-19 M/C TL 54H front at 2,20 bar or 31 psi

            4,00-18 M/C TL 64S/H rear at 2,30 bar or 33 psi

            MT66 in metric and the MT69E and MT68E « Strada » in inch. MT65 too.

            Nobody used any of those tires so far.

            M6102 front and M6103 rear.

            They scream and howl in corners according to Lawrence Hogarth. It may be safer not to use them.Your life probably is worth more to you than the 40$ difference per tire with a proper one.
