          <p>The list hosted
          a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/5united/message/42021">discussion
          in February, 2013 about sidestands for /5s</a>.  It was
          started by a message from "Jerry" asking about his R75/5
          which he thought leaned too far when on the stand.</p>

          <p>There was consensus that the original equipment sidestand
          is not good.  Several brands of aftermarket stands were
          mentioned, including Brown, Farley, and Swirin.</p>

          <p>Snippets from the conversation:</p>

          <blockquote>
            You can tell if it's bent if it won't tuck under the
            exhaust pipe and hit it's stop.
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            later years with the same form as /5 are thicker AND STRONGER
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            I think you're looking for a Brown's sidestand.  There
            also is a Farley sidestand, similar to the Brown's.
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            Look at this as a golden opportunity to rid yourself of
            the stock side stand. Get a Brown. You'll love it.
          </blockquote>

          <p>Duane Ausherman provided an overview of /5 side stands:</p>

          <blockquote>
            The Brown stand and others that follow a similar mounting system are all
quite good. The grandfather of them all was what was called the "Hall
Bracket" made by a guy in one of the southern states back in the mid 60s.
It used a stock Triumph leg mounted on his bracket that replaced the spacers
between the frame and engine. People loved them, as back then the only
alternative was the super funky one made by Flanders, the west coast
importer. It was really awful, but better than the stock one.<br/><br/>

I talked with Hall a few times on the phone and he was just a welder with a
/2 that decided that he could build something better than stock, and did.
People saw it and asked him to make them one. We consumers forced him into
the business. He was limited by the Triumph parts supply system, which was
poor. He just couldn't get enough of the side stand legs. He didn't want
to make up his own.<br/><br/>

After he gave up, we had no decent side stands for the next few years. Then
I think it was Brown who was the first to jump in and try to fill the gap,
but it could have been another. Brown was, and may still be, a BMW
motorcycle dealer who had once been the shop foreman for Flanders.<br/><br/>

Now, over the years, a few people have jumped into the business and produced
something along the lines of the original Hall Bracket.<br/><br/>

In my opinion, BMW never had a decent side stand or center stand. Virtually
all of the after market stands were better.<br/><br/>
