           <p><img src="./rotor.jpg" class="pull-right img-polaroid">On 
              BMW motorcycles, the 
              excitation circuit sends a voltage from the voltage regulator, through 
              the rotor brushes and into the rotor windings. The voltage flows 
              through the rotor windings and electromagnetic waves (flux) forms 
              around the rotor windings (you can't see 'em, but they're there). 
              The flux has a north pole and a south pole. The flux rotates as 
              the rotor rotates. When the invisible flux passes through the stator 
              (stationary) windings, a voltage is induced in the stator windings. 
              </p>

            <P>There are three sets 
              (phases) of windings in the stator. As the north and south pole 
              of the rotor's flux alternately pass through the stator's three 
              phase windings, an alternating positive and negative voltage (alternating 
              current AC) is induced in each phase winding. 
            <P> The 3-phase AC output 
              of the stator is conducted into the rectifier (diode board). A diode 
              acts like an electronic check valve and allows only the positive 
              voltage from the stator's 3-phase AC output to flow through. The 
              diode board output voltage polarity is always positive (direct current 
              DC). 
            <P> The DC output of the 
              diode board is conducted into the storage battery for later use 
              when the engine isn't running or to augment the electrical power 
              (watts) available for when the engine is running at low speed and 
              big system electrical loads (horn, lights, etc.) are switched on.
            <P> The faster the rotor 
              spins, the greater the induced stator voltage. The voltage regulator 
              acts to reduce the excitation voltage supplied by the voltage regulator 
              to the rotor. Less excitation voltage equals less flux and less 
              induced voltage in the stator windings. So, as the rotor spins faster, 
              the voltage regulator reduces the voltage supplied to the rotor 
              which ensures that there is not too much voltage induced into the 
              stator. In this way, the voltage regulator controls the alternator 
              output voltage level.<p>

            <P> <B>Tip:</B> The red 
              light on the speedo face is in the excitation circuit for the rotor. 
              If the bulb is the wrong wattage or is burned out, then the alternator 
              output will either be wrong or non-existent. Also, if the red gen 
              light does not come on with the key on and engine off, then there 
              is a break in the excitation circuit caused by burned out bulb, 
              broken rotor wire, brush not making contact with slip ring, voltage 
              not supplied from voltage regulator to rotor, bad circuit connection, 
              etc.. </font>
            <P> <B>Tip:</B>If the brushes 
              are dirty or the brush holders or rotor slip-rings are dirty then 
              you could get diminished alternator output.
            <P>
