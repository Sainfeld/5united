    <h1>5 United's Festivals of Five</h1>

      <div class="row prose">
	<div class="span12">
          <p>A "Festival of Fives" is a regional gathering of BMW /5 riders. Our rallies are informal and generally have fewer than 100 in attendance. Most riders are on vintage and classic BMWs with a high percentage being the /5 model, although all riders are welcome. We encourage you to gas up that airhead and come to a Festival near you!</p>

          <p>If you have a /5-friendly rally that you'd like us to post please <a href="../about/">contact us</a>.</p>

          <blockquote> Anybody doing a festival of fives at the BMWMOA rally in Salem Oregon in July?  I bet we could get a bunch up there for that!  My wife and I will ride ours (both) up there and we have a bunch of other fivers here in Ventura to wrangle into going.</blockquote>
