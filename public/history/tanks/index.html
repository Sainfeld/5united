      <h1>Fuel tanks on BMW motorcycles: 1970 - 1973</h1>

      <div class="pagetext prose">      

      <p><a href = "./bmwpr.jpg"><img src="./bmwpr.jpg"
	class="img-polaroid pull-left" width="350"/></a> In 1970 and 1971, BMW
	motorcycles had a 6.3 gallon fuel tank. This is the standard
	tank. This tank was available by special order in 1972. Many
	1973 /5s had it as well. The 1970 and 1971 gas cap hinges from
	the front of the fuel tank. The 1972 and 1973 gas cap hinges
	from the back.  In mid-1973, the standard tank had the cut-out
	for the brake master cylinder that would later appear on the
	/6.The black thing on the fuel tank is a large rubber pad. All
	standard tanks had these. When reattaching one of these to a
	painted fuel tank, 3m Super Weatherstrip (black) adhesive
	works well. This automotive type of adhesive is available at
	most auto parts stores. Photo is from BMW's archives.
	According to Phil Marx, slot blade screws affix the roundel to
	the fuel tank for 1970 and 1971.</p>

      <p>In 1972, most motorcycles that BMW exported to the United
	    States came with a fuel tank of less than 4.5 gallons. The
	    chrome panels mounted, as seen below in this
	    advertisement, were standard in the U.S. Notice the lack
	    of pinstriping around the chrome panel. Notice the chrome
	    battery cover? That was also a feature for the 1972
	    model. These tanks were also available in Europe. The
	    chrome paneled tanks were called "toasters."

	      </a>
This tank was not well received in the US market. Many
	    motorcyclists thought the chrome panels were ugly. It held less fuel
	    than the standard 6-gallon tank. Do not estimate a /5's year of
	    manufacture by the fuel tank. These were frequently swapped for
	    six-gallon tanks, and frequently on the dealers' showrooms.  Also,
	    some 1973 models were exported with the toaster tank. Dealers sent
	    many toaster tanks, complete with toaster panels, to the
	    scrapyard. </p>

	  <p>In 1972, the 6-gallon standard tank was available by special order
	    for an additional $25. Small rubber pads were available to replace the
	    chrome fuel tank panels, but only by special order from the dealer.
	    Philips head screws hold roundel on the fuel tank. Advertisement

      <p>Then there was 1973, the year of great confusion for
	restorers. Early 1973 models had chrome panels and the fuel tanks had
	pinstripes. Also in 1973, these rubber pads were available, and were
	supplied on the small tank after they stopped putting chrome panels on
	the fuel tanks. These pads were also available earlier by special
	order.  It is the same fuel tank as the Toaster tank, only instead of
	chrome panels, it had a rubber pad. Indentations on the black pad fit
	over the prongs that support the toaster panel. Also in 1973, the
	6-gallon tank was available as an option, for about $25. Click on the

      <p>This green tank is a Police tank. Notice that it looks
	very similar to the 6-gallon tank? It even has the same
	large rubber pad.But on top, there is a lid. And inside
	that lid is a carrying place. The black one is police tank
	with a radio still in place. Click on the photos to see a
