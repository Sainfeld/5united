	    <p>5 United is a club of classic BMW motorcycle enthusiasts. We ride, repair and restore the motorcycles built from 1970 - 1973 including the R75/5, R60/5 and R50/5.  5 United holds BMW Motorcycle Owners of America Charter #324 and BMW Riders Association Charter #324.</p>

	    <p>Our club centers around an e-mail list with mostly technical discussion, but riders get together for riding, wrenching and having a good time. Founded in 1995, we now have over 1400 members on six continents and at least 25 nations.</p>

	    <p>This website is a reflection of these discussions. It
	      was originally started in 1995 (5united.net) and managed by Dave
	      Anderson though 2009. Special thanks goes to Dave for all of his
	      efforts! Currently this site is managed by the following cast of
	      characters:</p>

	    <ul>
	      <li>Eric Miller, <strong>em at potlach dot org</strong>, 1972 R75/5 'die hexe'</li>
	      <li>Toby Cabot, <strong>toby at caboteria dot org</strong>, 1970 R50/5</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>on a volunteer basis. We work for beer, wrenching advise and accolades (pretty much in that order).</p>

	    <p>The raw content of this site is available
		via <a href="https://github.com/erimille/5united">github
		repository</a> to help provide a relatively simple,
		collaborative, cost-effective and efficent way to
		manage this site. If this makes sense to you, and
		you'd like to help, please send an email
		to <strong>contact at 5united dot org</strong>.</p>
