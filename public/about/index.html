	    <p>5 United is a club of classic BMW motorcycle enthusiasts. We ride, repair and restore the motorcycles built from 1970 - 1973 including the R75/5, R60/5 and R50/5.  5 United holds BMW Motorcycle Owners of America Charter #324 and BMW Riders Association Charter #324.</p>

	    <p>Our club centers around an e-mail list with mostly technical discussion, but riders get together for riding, wrenching and having a good time. Founded in 1995, we now have over 2000 members on six continents and at least 25 nations.</p>

	    <p>This website is a reflection of these discussions. It
	      was originally started in 1995 (5united.net) and managed by Paul Sotrop and then Dave
	      Anderson though 2009. Special thanks goes to Paul and Dave for all of their
	      efforts! Currently this site is managed by the following cast of
	      characters:</p>

	    <ul>
	      <li>Eric Miller, <strong>em at potlach dot org</strong>, 1972 R75/5 'die hexe'</li>
	      <li>Toby Cabot, <strong>toby at caboteria dot org</strong>, 1970 R50/5</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>on a volunteer basis. We work for beer, wrenching advise and accolades (pretty much in that order).</p>

            <p>Since 5 United was started many excellent /5 sites have
 disappeared from the Internet.  Groups like the Internet Archive try
 their best to archive the contents of the internet, but they don't
 always succeed and valuable information is lost forever. This web
 site is designed from the ground up to establish, maintain, and advance the capacity to
 preserve our communities's knowledge for the benefit of present and
 future /5 owners.</p>

	    <p>To facilitate this goal, the raw content of this site
		is available
		via <a href="https://github.com/erimille/5united">github
		repository</a> to help provide a relatively simple,
		collaborative, cost-effective and efficent way to
		help manage and preserve this data. If you'd like
		to help maintain this site, or willing to donate
		existing /5 web resources with a goal of
		long term preservation, please send an email
		to <strong>contact at 5united dot org</strong>.</p>
