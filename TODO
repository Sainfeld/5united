* Try to find Keith Porter to see if we can get the contents of
  slas5h.net.  There was a lot of good content there but it fell off
  the net in 2009.
  http://web.archive.org/web/20090703053702/http://www.slash5.net/

  At one time his site was considered one of the most important /5
  sites so it's a shame to lose that content and IA seems to have an
  incomplete crawl.

* upload alternative wiring diagrams:
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/5united/files/Jack%20Clarke%20Schematic/ - request for permission sent
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/5united/files/Nick%20Greear/
  DONE - hires scans ("thanks to B.B") from http://groups.yahoo.com/group/5united/files/Frequently%20asked%20Tech%20Question/Electrical/

* spring cleaning of files section
  multiple copies of FAQ files
  move pictures to photos section?
  move links to links section?
  will need moderator help with this

* add enduro bags to history bags article
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/5united/files/BMW%20Enduro%20Bags/

* battery article?

* motor oil article (maybe all fluids)?

* mirror/scrape sites that fell off the net:
  http://www.slash5.net/ - /5 service manual, /5 "information organizer"
  5united.net
  http://www.sat.net/~bberlin/riding.htm - color wiring diagrams?
  http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~baucom/bmw/index.html - Albian Baucom's homepage (including Duane Ausherman's comments on forks)
  http://users.online.be/~gi30979/ - Cris Vande Velde's homepage
  http://www2.tower.org/bmwsite/ - the BMWSite

* mirror/scrape sites still on the net but apparently abandoned
  http://personalpages.tds.net/~nsgreear/bikes/bmw/

* figure out how to archive the yahoo site, especially the mailing
  list and the files.
