5 United is a club of classic BMW motorcycle enthusiasts. We ride, repair and restore the motorcycles built from 1970 - 1973 including the R75/5, R60/5 and R50/5.

Our club centers around an e-mail list with mostly technical discussion, but riders get together for riding, wrenching and having a good time. Founded in 1995, we now have over 1400 members on six continents and at least 25 nations.
